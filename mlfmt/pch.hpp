 * This is a precompiled header file.
 * Files listed below are compiled only once, improving build performance for future builds.
 * This also affects IntelliSense performance, including code completion and many code browsing features.
 * However, files listed here are ALL re-compiled if any one of them is updated between builds.
 * Do not add files here that you will be updating frequently as this negates the performance advantage.
